When beginning the hackathon, we came up with the idea to create fitness app, 
we knew we wanted to create a mock-up of a feature similar to Nike run club where you 
can track your own progress but also see what friends are up to.

for our project, we decided we would use the streamlit library as supposed to other architectures such as Flask or Django,
especially since most of us don't have extensive front end abilitiies, 

we began with creating a login page, that can 
authenticate a user passed on their username and password, and possibly in the future integrating logins from other apps
the one setback of using streamlit that we ran into here is that 
we werent able to find a way to be able to redirect the page to a different URL and therefore be able to switch off this 
login page

so lets just pretend that the login page would redirect to our home page, which will place the user on the weekly fitness
plan landing page. Based on the fitness plan the user chooses, the weekly overview of all their exercises will change, for example,
changing to a push pull legs plan will change the exercises on the right

if we move onto the calendar, you get a more in-depth of the per day training where for both the weekly and daily plans, it
pulls from a SQLite database and creates exercise objects to be able to display the data to the user

due to our time constraint, we werent able to create a friends page as well as we liked, however, instead we have images exampling
seeing all your friends on the app such as Shrek and Yoda

a thing thats important to us, is making sure your doing the excercises correctly, because you can get seriously injured or hospitalized if
you are working out improperly, [showcase Hands]

finally, our last page is a nutrition calculator which depending on ther options you use, will determine how many calories, grams of carbs, proteins,
and fat you need within your diet to reach that goal.

I thank you for your time and I hope you enjoyed our app SizeUp!
